# Shopping-Sales-Trends-EDA-
Fictional retail sales analysis conducted with SQL and Tableau querying/calculations.

- Using the Chart Swap filter, change between Default View (product Color and Age Cluster segmentation) and Map View (States drilldown information).
- Very homogenous mock-up data, hence the minimal alterations of "trends".
